				<p class="team8-card-content">The internship program kick started with applicants joining the HNG internship slack team, where they were required to update 
				their profile with their full names, phone numbers, email and profile pictures. With that being done, they were given a set of tasks to complete which would 
				enable them proceed to the next stage of the internship application. Applicant were required to include their names in the contributors file on the hng-internship 
				github <a href = "https://github.com/hnginterns/getting-started-h2-2017">repository</a> and also create and push PHP & SQL files to their individual github repositories. 
				Quite a good number of prospective interns completed the given tasks and posted links for review before they were allowed to proceed to the next stage.
				<br><br>
				After the set of tasks in the first stage were completed, prospective interns were split into groups and were given both individual and group task to perform. 
				The individual task involved them creating their personal profile page and hosting it on the hng.fun/profile website and alot of them came up with very impressive pages which Mark Essien 
				posted links to in a series of tweets. The group task on the other hand involved collaborating and building this awesome website(hng.fun) which was a bit challenging but the worked together 
				and pulled through.
				<br><br>
				While the interns wait patiently to proceed to the next stage, they add finishing touches and make edits to their projects.
