                    <div class="name-body-text">I'm Mark Essien, born and grew up in the small town of Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
I did my primary school at Monika Kindergarten, and my secondary school at Federal Government, Ikot Ekpene. As you can tell, very much a small town upbringing.
After that, I moved to Germany to attend University. It was an interesting experience, but after many years in Germany, I decided that I prefer to live in Nigeria.</div>
