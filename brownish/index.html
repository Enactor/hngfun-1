			<p><i>I am native of Ikono Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and a graduate of Civil Engineering from the University of Port Harcourt (B.Eng).<br/>I have been working with computers for a couple of years even before my university education. I started off as a diploma holder in computer maintenance and network by 2003 and since then I have had a couple of hands on experiences in this field including working as a computer technician/network admistrator in different establishments both during and after my university days.<br/>I am currently working as a Software Technician/Server Administrator with a power generating company in Akwa Ibom State. I am a big fan of IT that is why I know the basics of several programming languages as well as some level of expertise in hardware maintenance/network administration & troubleshooting. I must confess I do no know much but I'm just smart and I hope this program will serve as a platform for me to upgrade my knowledge-base.<br/>Finally, I'm a gadget lover and a pimping freak :-)</i></p>
