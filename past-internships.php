        It was indeed a great success. Mark Esssien born and raised in Ikot
Ekpene, founder of hotels.ng along with Neo the CTO of the company
came up with an idea of an internship program for software developers
and put out a tweet. So many people applied, more than hundreds. He
was convinced that people wanted to learn software development and
so he went ahead with the plan. Well they decided they would pay but
how were the going to do this? It was indeed a tough decision. They
came up with an idea that it was going to be a remote internship,
anybody could join but only those who deliver features in the course of
the internship would get paid and they went on with the plan.
Assignments were given stage by stage which includes;
<ul>
<li>Setup git and pull and push some code which left only 80 people in
the program. </li>
<li>Write a bit of code (front-end mostly) and push to the repository and
only 30 people were left</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There and then, the internship started in earnest. The Interns were
given tasks, and each week they had to deliver whatever they were
given. Those who delivered got paid while those who did not didn’t get
paid following the plan.
As weeks passed, people started leaving slowly reasons being that
some could not meet up, and some because other things got in their
way. But the determined ones still persisted all the way through to the
end. 15 interns finished successfully. They did all their best just to
complete it even when the circumstances became tougher.</p>

<p>Finally they built 4 products for HNG which includes - Spots.ng (a listing
of places in Nigeria), Raven (an internal email sending tool), Locations
API (an API for Nigerian addressing system), and a yet to be released
(Hotels.ng for Businesses). </p>

<p>Three people were hired- Stephen Afam-Osmene (who started
university at 14), Gideon Onwuka (a quiet guy who hardly said anything,
but always was first in completing the tasks), and Fisayo Afoloyan (one
of the few guys that was as good on the front-end as on the backend.
It was really indeed a great success. They were picked up, they trained
themselves and now they making the world a better place.
Due to the success of HNG 1.0, HNG 2.0 has been setup to develop
more people in software. Remember, it is still a remote internship and
everyone is welcome. Anticipate powerfully and watch out for this
year’s great software developers….you don’t want to be left out.
