HNG Internship Task 2: How to push your profile page “hng.fun/profile/<yourusrename>.html” to the hngfun repository

I will take you through the process of adding your profile page to the hng.fun repository.

    I assume you have a Git account if not click here to join
    Your github account have been added to the HNG organization on github
    Sign in to github
    Visit the hngfun repo here
    Clone the repo to your local machine by copying the repo url

7. Open gitbash and clone with this command git clone <repo url> and hit enter

8. Be sure that you have an Apache Server running on your system as the clone repo is a php file.

9. Open the cloned repo with any text editor of your choice, and create your profile page

10. After adding your html file (i.e <yourusername.html>), save the file.

11. Change your current directory to the repo you cloned with the command cd <directory url>

12. Add the changes : git add . note the space after add

13. Commit your changes: git commit -m “commit message”

14. Before you push, you need to add remote: git remote add origin https://github.com/hnginterns/hngfun.git

15. Git is used for version control so you definitely cannot push your the repo on your local machine directly without updating yours with the repo on github. So before you push, do well to pull first: git pull: git pull origin master

16. Push your changes back to the hngfun repo: git push -u origin master

15. If successful, you can view your profile page by visiting the URL: http://hng.fun/profile/<yourusername>.html like mine http://hng.fun/profile/profchydon.html

Thanks.
